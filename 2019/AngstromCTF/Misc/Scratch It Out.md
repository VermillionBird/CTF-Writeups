`An oddly yellow cat handed me this `<a href='https://files.actf.co/397a7663cfc657bea92b8038eb2a27804ac75ba56b74e56572e57f00414fd43f/project.json'>message</a>` - what could it mean?`

Mozilla allows you to open json files in a new tab and formats it for readability. The following highlighted lines, combined with the title and the description make me think of the programming language Scratch.

Scratch has a desktop version, saving scratch projects using the extension '`.sb2`'. Searching this on Google, I find that the files are a zip file, containing assets and a json file. Therefore, I downloaded the json and renamed it as a scratch file.

I then uploaded it to the scratch website.
