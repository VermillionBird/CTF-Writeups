I don't know why, but crypto challenges are always fun for me.

I'm pretty embarassed this took me as long as it did. I didn't recognize the cipher right away, but its just a ROT47. Use any <a href='https://www.dcode.fr/rot-47-cipher'>online decoder</a> you want. The one I used outputted:
```
Org lbh pna'g fbyir guvf punyyratr!

sun{w3lC0m3_T0_da_k4g3!}
```
Literally no clue what the first line was supposed to be, but the flag was valid.

flag: `sun{w3lC0m3_T0_da_k4g3!}`

*Edit*: The first line is a ROT13 after the ROT47: `Bet you can't solve this challenge!` Why they would make the flavor text another step, I have no idea.
