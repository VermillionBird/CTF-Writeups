Someone sent me this weird file and I don't understand it. It's freaking me out, this isn't a game! Please help me figure out what's in this file.

I spent a while searching up Golly Gee Willikers, which of course didn't return anything. But searching something else certainly does; open the text file to see:

This isn't crypto, so its not encryption. I searched up the first line, since it seemed distinct. Google outputs a Wikipedia page on cellular automata, and states that B3/S23 is a rule for Conway's Game of Life. I've messed around with Conway's Game of Life before, but haven't seen this kind of text. I scanned through the article to find <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Notable_programs'>this</a>.

Golly turns out to be a program for running Conway's Game of Life. I downloaded <a href='http://golly.sourceforge.net/'>Golly</a>, but you don't have to. There's actually a <a href='copy.sh/life'>website</a> for it. I pasted the entire text into Golly, and it turned out to just be a bunch of characters. I ran the simulation, and nothing seemed to come out of it. So there has to be more than that.

At this point, I had learned that the text was a Run Length Encoded file for Golly/Game of Life. So I decided to search up the way that Game of Life files are encoded using RLE. I found this <a href='http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded'>website</a>, which helped me understand what each character did in the text. Most notably, the website says:

`The last <run_count><tag> item is followed by a ! character.` and `Anything after the final ! is ignored.`

If you notice, there's two exclamation points at the end of the text: `5bo30bo!$$$$13b...b2ob2o!`. Copypaste the code after the first '`!`', making sure to keep the first line '`x = 0, y = 0, rule = B3/S23`', and you'll get the flag:

The flag might be in another castle.

Solved this one prehint too. Yay me.

I first downloaded the file. Mounting it gives you four jpeg images. Nothing interesting there.

## 250 points: Sonar

We think a wrestler called Sonar wants to rebrand and go to a competitor. We have to reason to believe that he was sending them his new wrestling name, lucky that our next-gen firewall was capturing the traffic during the time where he sent that info out. Unfortunately our staff cannot make heads or tails of it. Mind looking at it for us?

Darn. I didn't get this one during the challenge perse, but I definitely could've. Download the pcapng and open it in Wireshark. You don't need to unzip it.

![](/Images/2019/SunshineCTF/wireshark.PNG)

It's a pretty big file, so I decided to look at the protocols:

![](/Images/2019/SunshineCTF/prothier.PNG)

I got fixated on the Internet Group Management Protocol, since it had the least packets sent. I even confirmed this with an admin, so I looked through the IGMP files, but didn't find anything at all. So I gave up there. But guess what? When I asked the admin, I shortened it to IGMP, and the admin thought I meant ICMP. After the competition, I found that out real fast.

![](/Images/2019/SunshineCTF/darn.PNG)

RIP. To be fair, ICMP also had one of the lower number of packets. So uh, maybe I shouldn't have given up. Continuing on, filtering by ICMP gives us:

![](/Images/2019/SunshineCTF/icmp.PNG)

Notice something? The data is just random characters. Why would that be? Unless, it has something to do with the data length...

In the image above, the packet I've highlighted has a data length of 115 bytes and a total length of 165 bytes. The next unique data length, since there are groups of consecutive packets with the same data length, is 117 with a total length of 167 bytes. Then it was 110 bytes/160 bytes, followed by 123bytes/173 bytes. 

`115 117 110 123`...Why that's the ascii codes for `sun{`! I recognized that immediately, and since the total length is just the data length plus 50, I started recording down all the ascii codes:
`115, 117, 110, 123, 055, 085, 099, 072, 097, 095, 076, 049, 066, 114, 051, 125`.
Using this <a href='http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/ascii/'>website</a>, I converted it to text and got:

flag: `sun{7UcHa_L1Br3}`

Darn, could've gotten 250 more points.

Hey we found this SD card in one of wrestlers' Rubixâ„¢ cubes but we can't make heads or tails of it. Maybe you can figure out what's in it...

Okay, so I'm really mad about this one. You'll see why in time, but just know that I deserved 250 more points.

Download the image, and try to mount it. You'll find that it's password protected. Looks like its a hashcat bashing problem. To be honest, I didn't know all too much about hashcat, so I followed this handy little <a href='https://articles.forensicfocus.com/2018/02/22/bruteforcing-linux-full-disk-encryption-luks-with-hashcat/'>tutorial</a>, specifically the 4th part where it mentions hashcat. Luckily, all my information was the same as theirs. Following it gets me:

Oops. Something's wrong. Luckily, I found the answer pretty quickly; I just added a `--force` option to the end, and it started running. But uh...I'm running on a VM so this happened:

<img src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555118456593317910/562087763378438146/unknown.png'>

That was 3 minutes after the competition ended. And it still took another 8 hours or so. Darn.

<img src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555118456593317910/562223026851020800/unknown.png'>

The morning after the competition ended, I got the password: `filosofia`. And opening the file with that password gets you:

![](/Images/2019/SunshineCTF/darnit.PNG)

flag: `SUN{wrasslin}`

Yeah, so you can tell I'm mad.
