WrestlerBook is the social network for wrestlers, by wrestlers. WrestlerBook is exclusively for wrestlers, so if you didn't get an invite don't even bother trying to view our profiles.

It's a simple login screen, and being a basic web challenge, it's probably SQLi (SQL injection). First thing I do is try to login using '`' or '1'='1`' as both the username and the password. It works, but all you get is this:

Looks like its going to be a bit more work than I thought.
