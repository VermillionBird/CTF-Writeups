`That's not `<a href='https://static.tjctf.org/fd5b2b8a27dc2255ffe96c2b6fca3f4434f3a71f35f5c6b7be16d8ef0c095688_rain.mp3'>rain</a>`, is it?`

Listen to the track and you'll eventually reach a section where you can hear weird, distorted speech. For this one, I opened the file in Audacity and did the following:
<ul>
  <li>Reversed the track</li>
  <li>Sped up the track</li>
  <li>Shifted the pitch up</li>
</ul>

You can play with the settings until you find a track where you can hear `(Curly brace)isr3v3r_aka(Curley brace)ftcjt` which is the flag backwards.

flag: `tjctf{aka_r3v3rsi}`
