## CTFs?

CTFs, or Capture the Flag Events, are competitions in which participants are given challenges related to computer security. This may include reverse engineering programs, exploiting programs, exploiting websites, cracking encryption and ciphers, forensically investigating files, and using general knowledge in order to obtain a "flag". Flags, usually a string of the form " are then submitted for points, and the teams that get the most points the fastest win.
